#### This package contains python code that demonstrates various models and setting in deep learning.

#### It consists of the following task:
1. Simulating a function (sine)
2. Training model on actual task using MNIST data to recognise handwritten characters. 
3. Comparing the performance of NN as number of parameters vary.
4. Observing change in gradient norm as training proceeds.
5. Observing the results if the labels of MNIST data set were randomised
6. Understanding sensitivity in neural networks. 


#### Required python packages
1. Pytorch
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Pandas


#### To run the code, simply execute the notebook using Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab. Thank you.
